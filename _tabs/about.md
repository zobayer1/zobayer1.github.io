#### Hi! I’m Zobayer.

Just a tech guy knee-deep in code, making a living in the software engineering world. For the formal stuff, check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zobayer-hasan/).

Off the clock, I'm all about exploring new places, devouring books, gaming until the break of dawn, and bike rides that clear the mind. Synth-wave and electro-pop fuel my coding marathons. Yes, music is serious business.

Here, I spill ink on my coding adventures, the hurdles I stumble over, cool tech finds, and pro tips to save your sanity. Expect the occasional rant — all part of the charm.

Wanna connect? Hit me up!
