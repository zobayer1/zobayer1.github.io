#### Hi! I am Zobayer

A headstrong open source enthusiast, writing codes for a living. Check me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zobayer-hasan/) for a full professional résumé.

Apart from coding, I enjoy visiting new places, reading, writing, playing video games, and riding my bike. Huge fan of synth-wave and electro-pop. Music is my jam.

I am writing about things I have been learning, the problems and challenges I have faced during software development, new and interesting technologies, programming ideas, tips and tricks, tutorials, and sometimes, very opinionated banters.

Let's connect!
