#### Hello World!

After a long pause filled with the bustling demands of life, I've finally carved out a bit of free time. Why not dive back into writing? Sure, I might be my own solitary reader, but honing my technical writing skills still feels like a valuable endeavor.

Dusting off the old platforms of Blogger and WordPress didn't appeal to me this time. I was on the lookout for something streamlined, something that didn't bury the joy of writing under clunky dashboards. That's when my friend [Mishuk](https://github.com/syedarehaq) steered me towards GitHub Pages and Jekyll. As it turns out, the world of static site generators has its own charm.

Jumping into Jekyll turned out to be surprisingly straightforward. A few hours later, I brought this site to life. And the cherry on top? I ventured into this without any background in Ruby gems or delving into the complexities of sass. Yet, my comfort with markdown, thanks to endless project README files and documentation writing, paid off handsomely. The concept of pushing a post into a GitHub repo to publish it? Absolutely thrilling.

#### Why did I choose Chirpy

[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/tree/master) is a minimalist theme for github-pages. The bootstrapping was easy and straight forward. My main reasons for choosing this theme are

1. **Dark Mode** out of the box!!!
2. Easy analytics integration.
3. Very active dev [community](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/discussions).
4. Did I mention **DARK MODE**???

I'm excited for this new journey and the stories, challenges, and learnings I'll share along the way.
