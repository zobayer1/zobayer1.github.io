It has been a really, really looooong time since I wrote anything in a blog. Last I wrote on [I, Me and Myself](http://zobayer.blogspot.com/) was sometime around November of 2015, and [my other blog](https://zobayer2009.wordpress.com) was even older. Life got busier and I had to take a step back from everything else.

Finally, some of my worries are now over, and I have a little bit of free time to get some things done outside of job and family life. So, I thought, why not start blogging again? Sure, no one's gonna read it, but that doesn't mean I can't work on my technical writing skills.

I didn't want to go back to blogger or wordpress, since those sites were really heavy, and I didn't want to get inside huge clumsy dashboards to get simple things done. I was looking for a simpler blogging media. So, I started asking around, and my good friend [Mishuk](https://twitter.com/syedarehaq) suggested that I should look into GitHub pages and Jekyll. Apparently, static site generation is a big thing these days in the web world (which I barely know anything about).

And guess what, people weren't joking when they said using Jekyll would be easier. I spent a few hours and this is the site I came up with. Best part is, I haven't even gotten into all that sass jazz yet. I am still working on adding features and customizing the `Minima` theme. However, I am quite familiar with markdown since I have to use that on a regular basis for writing documentations and project `README` files. Publish a post just by pushing it into a GitHub repo? Hell yeah!!!

Things I need to add to this site:
 - Pagination
 - Tag Processing
 - Add disqus comment
 - And some actual articles(!)

Really hoping that I can keep it up this time.
